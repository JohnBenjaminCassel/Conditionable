This code is for the purpose of evaluating conditions over sets of variables.  
For example, the expression "cond $x > [$y] && cond $y > [$z]", provided with 
1, 2, and 3 wrapped as to make them variables, would determine that there is a 
valid assignment, namely $x=3, $y=2, and $z=1

This code is provided primarily for academic purposes, and requires additional 
libraries to run.  Should you actually desire to use it, please let me know
(JohnBenjaminCassel on github) and I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.
